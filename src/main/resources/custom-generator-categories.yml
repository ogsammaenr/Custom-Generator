#     ‚öôÔ∏è CUSTOM GENERATOR CATEGORIES - custom-categories.yml
#
# This file defines custom generator categories based on
# fluid and block combinations.
#
# Each category determines when a generator type is triggered
# based on surroundings like block type, y-level, biome, etc.
#
# NOTE: Use valid Bukkit Material names for all block types.
#       List of all materials:

custom-categories:

  # üîπ EXAMPLE CATEGORY: dirt_generator
  # This category activates when lava flows into air,
  # and specific surrounding block conditions are met.
  dirt_generator:
    category: DIRTGEN                        # Unique ID for this generator category. Must match a generator-type in generator-types.yml
    display-name: "&2Dirt"                   # Display name shown in the GUI
    fluid: LAVA                              # The fluid that triggers the generator (e.g., LAVA or WATER)
    to: AIR                                  # The block the fluid flows into (e.g., AIR, STONE)

    conditions:
      sides: [ DIRT ]                        # Blocks that must be on the four horizontal sides of the flowing fluid
      up: [ STONE ]                          # Block above the flowing fluid
      down: [ COARSE_DIRT ]                          # Block below the flowing fluid

    y-level:
      min: 10                                # Minimum Y level where this generator is valid
      max: 64                                # Maximum Y level where this generator is valid

    biomes: # List of biomes where this generator is allowed
      - minecraft:plains
      - minecraft:the_void

  sky_ice:
    category: SKYGEN
    display-name: "&bSky Ice"
    fluid: WATER

      up: [ SNOW_BLOCK ]
      sides: [ PACKED_ICE ]
    y-level:
      min: 280

#   - sides: Blocks on the four cardinal sides (north, south, east, west)
#   - up: Block directly above the fluid
#   - down: Block directly below the fluid

# üî∏ y-level:
# Sets the vertical height range in which this generator is allowed to work.

# üî∏ biomes:
# Restricts the generator to specific biomes only.
# Use valid Minecraft biome IDs like `minecraft:desert` or `minecraft:forest`.
