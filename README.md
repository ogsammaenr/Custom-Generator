## üöÄ Quick¬†Start

1. **Download** the `CustomGenerator.jar` file and place it inside your server‚Äôs `plugins/` directory.  
2. Start the server once to generate default configuration files:  
   * `messages.yml` ‚Äî customizable message strings   
   * `generator-types.yml` ‚Äî definitions for all generator types  
3. Modify the YAML files according to your server‚Äôs needs and preferences.  
4. Use the command `/generator reload` or restart the server to load your custom settings.  
5. Encourage players to use `/generator help` to see available commands and usage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Basics

### Defining Generator Types
Generator types are defined inside the `generator-types.yml` file. You can add new types or modify existing ones. Each entry specifies how the generator behaves and appears in the GUI. Here is an example:


```
generator-types:
  diamond:
    display-name: "&bDiamond Generator"
    material: DIAMOND_ORE           # GUI icon material (must be a valid Bukkit Material)
    lore:
      - "&bContains rare and valuable resources."
      - "&7Produces 30% diamond and 70% stone blocks."
    generator-type: COBBLESTONE     # Category: one of COBBLESTONE, STONE, BASALT, DEEPSLATE
    price: 5000                     # Cost in economy currency (Vault)
    required-island-level: 30       # Minimum BentoBox island level required
    blocks:                         # Defines block output chances as relative weights (does not need to sum to 1)
      STONE: 70
      DIAMOND_ORE: 30
```
### Important notes:

* The generator-type field must be one of the four hard-coded categories.

* Values under blocks: act as relative weights. The plugin normalizes these internally, so whether you use 70/30, 0.7/0.3, or 7/3, the behavior is consistent.

* The price supports decimal values if your economy plugin allows it.

* material must be a valid [Bukkit Material](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html) for GUI icons.

* lore supports multiple lines and color codes to describe the generator.
